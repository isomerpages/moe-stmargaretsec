CCA Policy
----------

*   Every secondary school student is required to take part in one main CCA, which can be from one of the following categories: Sports, Performing Arts, Uniformed Groups or Clubs.
    
*   Participation has to be continuous with 75% attendance throughout the secondary school course before points can be considered. Absence from any CCA session must be supported by medical certificates or letters from parents stating a valid reason.
    

LEAPS 2.0 CCA Grading System
----------------------------

To provide students with a holistic and well-rounded experience in the co-curriculum, we have introduced the LEAPS 2.0 framework in secondary schools since 2014. LEAPS 2.0 aims to schools to better align their co-curriculum to encourage students’ holistic development in life skills, competencies and values.

  

LEAPS 2.0 has 4 domains as shown below:

*   Participation
*   Service
*   Leadership
*   Achievement

  

More information on LEAPS 2.0 and the conversion of level of Attainment to Bonus Points can be obtained from the MOE's website at [https://www.moe.gov.sg/education-in-sg/our-programmes/cca/leaps2-0](https://www.moe.gov.sg/education-in-sg/our-programmes/cca/leaps2-0) .
