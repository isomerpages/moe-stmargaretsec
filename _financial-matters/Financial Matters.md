Registration for PayNow
-----------------------

With the increasing digitalisation of government services, MOE would like to encourage all parents to register their children’s bank account with  PayNow using the children’s BC/NRIC number. The activation of PayNow will facilitate the prompt disbursement of monies for the child, and avoid delays through the filling in and processing of forms or from physical visits to banks for the deposit of cheques. For a start, MOE will be using PayNow (BC/NRIC) as a means to disburse Edusave award monies starting from the upcoming Edusave award exercise in Dec 2021.

  

Insurance Coverage for Students
-------------------------------

All students are covered by MOE Master Contract for Group Personal Accident (GPA) Insurance under NTUC Income Co-operative Limited. Under this contract, students who participated in school activites will be covered. All claims submitted to the insurance provided must be endorsed by the school. Should you find the coverage inadequate to meet your child's/ward's needs, you may consider purchasing your own insurance policy.
