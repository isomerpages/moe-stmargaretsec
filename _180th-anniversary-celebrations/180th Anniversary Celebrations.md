In 2022, we celebrate the 180th year of the founding of St. Margaret’s School. To commemorate this joyous milestone, we have put together this online virtual concert and Family Activity Box specially for everyone. 

This online virtual concert with its theme aligned to Mrs Maria Dyer's legacy of love and service to the community will be told through the tale of Father Charis and his two daughters, Arlene and Zanna.

This is our first time putting this together and we really hope that you will enjoy it with your loved ones.
