#### **Highlights of Sports Meet 2023** 

Held on Friday, 10 March 2023, the Sports Meet was a novel event for almost all levels as this is the first held since 2019. The House spirit was almost palpable in the rousing cheers and spirited rooting for the athletes! 

The competitive as well as fun integrative races brought the students, staff and parents together as never before.
