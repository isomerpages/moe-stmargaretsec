<h3><strong>POSB Smart Buddy Programme</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Our school has been working closely with POSB for the past couple of months
and we are pleased to finally announce that we have successfully implemented
POSB Smart Buddy as an e-payment option in our school canteen and bookstore.
This is in support of the <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/news/press-releases/20220413-dbs-posb-and-moe-partner-to-broaden-access-to-digital-payments-in-schools" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MOU</a> that
MOE has partnered with POSB to extend Smart Buddy to all schools in Singapore.
With this implementation in St. Margaretâ€™s School (Secondary), all our
students can now opt to use e-payments for their in-school purchases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More information about the programme can be found in Annex A, B and C.

be able to experience digital payments in a safe and secured environment.</p>
