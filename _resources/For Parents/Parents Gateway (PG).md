<p>Parents Gateway (PG) is a mobile app specially designed for parents. Developed
by MOE&nbsp;and GovTech, the app allows parents to engage closely with
schools, receive information and perform a range of administrative functions
including giving consent for school trips.</p>
<p>The school uses PG&nbsp;<strong>fully</strong>&nbsp;for all engagements
with parents. Hard copies of consent forms and other means of communication
will only be provided for a student if none of the parents are eligible
for SingPass.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All&nbsp;Singapore Citizens / Permanent Residents / Employment Pass holders
and some eligible&nbsp;Work Permit holders are able to register for SingPass.
If you are eligible for SingPass,&nbsp;we&nbsp;would like to invite you
to download&nbsp;the free PG mobile app on your mobile phone (available
on iOS and Android platforms only) and perform a simple one-time onboarding
process if you have not done so.&nbsp;Please refer to the&nbsp;<a href="/files/PG%20for%20Website.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Parents Gateway Instructional Guide</a>&nbsp;or
watch this&nbsp;<a href="https://tinyurl.com/PGonboarding" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">video</a>&nbsp;if
you need assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Currently the school is making use of PG for the following engagements with parents:</strong> 
<br>
<br>1. Consent for school trips&nbsp;
<br>2. Announcements&nbsp;
<br>3. Travel Declarations
<br>4. Update of parents contact details

<br>6. Book meeting sessions for PTM</p>
