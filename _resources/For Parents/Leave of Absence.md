Singapore Citizen and Permanent Resident who are planning to go overseas for work or related concerns may reserve places for their children in their current school under the Leave of Absence (LOA) Scheme. The children can be readmitted directly to their schools upon their return to Singapore.

Applicants are to submit the LOA [application form](https://form.gov.sg/#!/60fa5e9bae0c000012a68ed5) and contact the school on the outcome and LOA fees.
