Each student is covered with a Group Personal Accident (GPA) Insurance which provides coverage when she is 

*   In school;
*   Participating in the school’s activities, or any activity related to the school, including home-based learning & blended learning, Co-Curricular Activities (“CCAs”) and sports, regardless of the time at which such activities are conducted and whether the activity is conducted in the school, in Singapore, or elsewhere;
*   Commuting from (or to) her place of residence, including a hostel, to (or from) either the school’s premises or the place where an activity covered by the GPA Insurance will be conducted, including any reasonable deviations. For the avoidance of doubt, the student’s place of residence may include a place that is not in Singapore.

 Please submit your child’s insurance claim via the Student GPA Claims Portal at [Student GPA Claims Portal (incomegroupins.com.sg)](https://studentgpa.incomegroupins.com.sg/#/)
