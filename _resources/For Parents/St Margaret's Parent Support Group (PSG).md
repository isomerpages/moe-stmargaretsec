<h2 align="center"> Who We Are  <br> PSG Mission </h2>

To promote a partnership between the school and parents by meeting the needs of the students, teachers and parents.  

The Parent Support Group (PSG) was formed in 1998 by a group of caring and committed parents to support the school and to participate in their daughters’ education and development. Starting with a small group of less than 10 parents, the SMSS PSG has grown to an impressive 550 members made up of active parent volunteers who support the school in various areas.

The school is also blessed with the PSG Alumni, formed in 2005 to facilitate the continuing fellowship amongst parents whose daughters have graduated.

The group plays a supportive role in school programmes and activities in enriching our girls’ SMSS education experience. Some key programmes supported by the PSG include school learning journeys, post-examination activities and NE commemorative days.
