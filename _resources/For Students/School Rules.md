<h2>Discipline Philosophy</h2>
<p>We believe that discipline is an education process. The goal is to instill
self-discipline and good&nbsp;character in students. We believe that every
child can learn right from wrong and is capable&nbsp;of responsible behaviour.
As such, we provide a positive and supportive environment that is&nbsp;conducive
for the learning of moral values, leadership and responsibility.</p>
<p>Rules and regulations are necessary as they maintain a conducive environment
for learning.&nbsp;They help to develop self-discipline and a sense of
responsibility which are essential qualities&nbsp;for success in life.</p>
<h2>General Conduct</h2>
<p>Have good manners and show respect, care and concern for everyone.&nbsp;Be
a good example to your peers.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Be polite and well-behaved at all times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Greet all staff and visitors to the school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Show respect and obey school authority (school staff and student leaders).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be considerate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take good care of school property and keep the premises clean and litter
free.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uphold the good name of the school</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Be Responsible and Disciplined</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Students must be accountable for their attendance. All absences from school
and school activities e.g. remedial lessons and CCAs must be covered by
a medical certificate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students should report to school before the following times to be in time
for the morning assembly:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays 7.30am</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wednesdays 8.40am</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Students should attend all classes, CCAs and other school activities punctually
and regularly.</p>
</li>

<p>Students should attend school for the full duration of the school term.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students who wish to leave the school during school hours are required
to write in at least 3 working days in advance to obtain permission from
the Principal/Vice-Principals through their Form Teacher.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Absence from assessments/examinations must be covered by a medical certificate
or the student will receive a zero mark for the paper. Absence from assessments/examinations
that are covered by letters of excuse will only be accepted under extenuating
circumstances e.g. bereavement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The school will only accept up to a maximum of 4 letters of excuse from
the parent/guardian in a year for valid reasons, or under extenuating circumstances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students should not have in possession any prohibited items. These include
items such as&nbsp;cigarettes, vapes, alcohol and sharp objects (e.g. Swiss
Army knife, penknife).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All students are not allowed to have in their possession any weapon or
weapon-like item.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students are strongly discouraged from bringing valuables to school (e.g.
mobile phones, large sums of money, jewellery) as these items are not required
for school activities and programmes. Students who choose to bring such
valuables to school must be responsible for the safekeeping of the items</p>
