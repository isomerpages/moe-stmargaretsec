Each new year marks a fresh chapter and a renewed invitation to reflect on how far we have come and to look forward with expectant hearts to a new start. Our theme for this year, “Growing in Grace,” reminds us that growth is not only measured in achievements, but in the depth of character, compassion, and resilience.

This promise is echoed in Isaiah 43:19:  
_“See, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it?”_ As a school, we hold fast to this assurance—that God continues His good work amongst us, guiding every step as we work toward a future filled with purpose and possibility.

**From the Fruit of the Spirit to a Season of GRACE**

Over the years, we have focused our efforts to understand and appreciate what it means to live guided by our school motto of Charity, Patience, Devotion. We also learn through our school tagline of #BeWell, #BeConnected, #BeALight. In 2025, learning about the **Fruit of the Spirit** helped shape our hearts and minds to cultivate love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and temperance. These virtues remain deeply embedded in who we are. In 2026, we build on this foundation by placing a renewed emphasis on ***GRACE (and LIGHT)***, aligning closely with our school’s core values. GRACE will guide us to grow with the following focus:

 **1\. Gratitude (Learning Continuously)**

 **2\. Resilience (Being Resilient and Tenacious)**

**3\. Authenticity (Upholding Integrity)**

**4\. Care (Showing Care and Being Gracious)**

 **5\. Empowered (Taking Pride and Being Humble)**

**Celebrating Our Growth**

We enter 2026 with gratitude and pride for what our school community has accomplished in the past years. In **Term 4 of 2025**, the school received a very affirming **Customised Validation Report** and I am humbled by this. It affirmed our steadfast commitment to quality teaching, holistic development, and fostering a caring school culture.

The report commended the school on having

* **strong teacher-student relationships**
* **robust programmes in student well-being and character development**
* **effective learning experiences grounded in clarity, support, and high expectations**

These affirmations reflect the expertise, love, patience and devotion of our educators, as well as our students’ commitment to growth and learning. This is also testament to the trust of and partnership with our stakeholders and parents. It is a milestone that strengthens our resolve to pursue excellence in growth and character, with humility and gratitude. Reflecting on the report’s findings encourages us to live out our values more intentionally, creating a community where every action is anchored in compassion, respect, and a desire to uplift one another.

We step into this new season with confidence—trusting that we will continue to grow in grace. As a community, our desire is also to grow in unity, wisdom, and purpose. &nbsp;We will continue to focus on

* **exploring innovative and effective pedagogies**
* **strengthening student voice and leadership pathways**
* **deepening partnerships and collaboration with the community**
* **enhancing support systems that promote well-being and holistic growth**

May God’s grace envelope and lead us forward into all that He is preparing for us.

Together, let us embrace **Growing in Grace**—honouring our past, celebrating the present, and stepping boldly into the new.
