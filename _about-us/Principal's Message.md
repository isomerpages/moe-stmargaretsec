2023 brings new beginnings, new hopes and new opportunities. I pray and trust that we will all learn and grow to be better versions of ourselves. I believe that God has much in store for us as we continue to work together with the primary school to hone our identity as St. Margaret’s School (Primary) and St. Margaret’s School (Secondary). May we continue to fix our eyes on God our Provider believing that God can will enable us to make a difference and help us to be a blessing to people around us. 

In 2023, we will continue to work on the same theme that we had in 2022 - “Let your light shine before men; that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven” (Matthew 5:16). It is indeed our collective prayer that the light of God shines forth in our school and each member of our community be able to serve God, the Country and the Community as clearly expounded in our School Mission Statement.  

Let us also, as a community – staff, alumni, parents, students – work at living out our commitment to #BeWell, #BeConnected and #BeALight. As a community, we continue our endeavor to look after the wellness of each child as we help them nurture and grow her talents, potential and strength areas. I look forward to another year where we see our students connecting with family, friends and community where they learn more about themselves and also how they can serve, be a blessing and “be a light”.  

I would also like to share that the ‘student outcomes’ that we collectively work towards are that our learners (1) are future-ready; (2) with growth mindset; (3) are other-centered and (4) who are dedicated members of the St. Margaret’s family. With strong partnerships and a dedicated staff, let us press on in our undaunted effort to make that positive impact in the lives of our students that they can indeed grow and glow in a caring and enabling environment. 

As we take bold and careful steps into 2023 as the world moves out of the Covid-19 pandemic, let us be reminded that “Thus far, the Lord has helped us” (1 Samuel 7:12). God has indeed protected and seen us through the past couple of years and we believe that He will be our fount of blessings moving forward.

To God Be the Glory!
