St. Margaret’s School celebrates the 180th Anniversary of our school founding in 2022 and the theme is “Let our Light Shine”. This is taken from Matthew 5:16 “…let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.” Our rallying call is for us to #BeALight. To shine through the darkness. This year we want to celebrate 180 years of learning and growing as a school and a community. As a community we celebrate because even as we emerge from the pandemic, we are learning to dance in the rain, dance through the pain and with grit we are poised to rise from the ashes. 

In 2023, St. Margaret’s Secondary School and St. Margaret’s Primary School will be renamed as St. Margaret’s School (Secondary) and St. Margaret’s School (Primary) respectively. This will better reflect our common legacy, heritage and school motto of Charity, Patience and Devotion.

As part of the celebrations for the 180th Anniversary and in honour of the legacy of our founding Principal, Mrs Maria Dyer, the school Performing Arts CCAs and the Uniformed Groups came together to work on a virtual concert on the narrative of ‘Father Charis’. It is enhanced by activities and conversation cards put together in a ‘Family Activity Box’. We hope that families can watch the concert, do the activities together and in turn, build deeper relationships. The school has presented 500 of these to the community in Ghim Moh. We are also making them available for you to purchase today and all proceeds will go to the SMPS school building fund.

The two schools also came together virtually on 20 May 2022 to mark the countdown of 180 days to Founders’ Day on 16 November 2022. On that day, the school also launched the 180 days of #LetitShine activities designed for the school community to apply and appreciate our School Motto better. 

The school is also designing a virtual trail to showcase the heritage and progress of our school. This will launch later in the year.

As a St. Margaret’s community, we want to indeed be a light that shines brightly to brighten up one another’s day in times of peace and hope when darkness assails.  I would like to quote from Thomas Rhett’s song “Be a Light”:

**In a world full of hate, be a light.  When you do somebody wrong, make it right**

**Oh Don't hide in the dark, you were born to shine. In a world full of hate, be a light**

As we move cautiously out of this pandemic, as we hear of and experience chaos and unrest around the region and the world, it is even more crucial that we press on and be tenacious. Continue to stand firm and be there for one another. We are certain that God will continue to lavish us with MORE of His blessings and love. Let us, as a community that includes our parents, alumni and community partners, continue to enjoy synergies that will enable our students to learn and grow for the good of the larger community. May we also invite all to #BeWell, #BeConnected and #BeALight.

To God be the Glory.

Yours sincerely,

Ms Linda Lim  
Principal  
St. Margaret’s Secondary School
