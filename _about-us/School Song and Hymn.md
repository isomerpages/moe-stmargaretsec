<h2>School Song</h2>
<p>(Music and Lyrics by Vivian Quek)</p>
<p>In these sound walls a goodly learning frame
<br>Who here abide true kindliness impart
<br>With steadfast love, devotion firm inflame
<br>The fire that waits in every heart.</p>
<p><em>For Charity, Patience,<br>Devotion let's be known.<br>These qualities St. Margaret's shown<br>On which our school has grown.</em>
</p>
<p>We learn to serve our God, our State, our School
<br>In service free for neighbour, home and friend
<br>So may we keep the all embracing rule
<br>In care for all our lives to spend.</p>
<p>When life brings pain, when trials us defy
<br>Our faith, our hope, our discipline require
<br>Us to withstand respond with spirit high
<br>St. Margaret's shall again inspire.</p>

<h2>School Hymn</h2>
<p>Our Father, by whose servants
<br>Our school was built of old
<br>Whose hand hath crowned her children
<br>With blessings manifold
<br>For Thine unfailing mercies
<br>Far strewn along our way
<br>With all who passed before us
<br>We praise Thy name today.</p>
<p>The changeful years unresting
<br>Their silent course have sped
<br>New comrades ever bringing
<br>In comrades' steps to tread
<br>And some are long forgotten
<br>Long spent their hopes and fears
<br>Safe rest they in Thy keeping
<br>Who changest not with years.</p>
<p>They reap not where they laboured
<br>We reap what they have sown
<br>Our harvest may be garnered
<br>By ages yet unknown
<br>The days of old have dowered us
<br>With gifts beyond all praise
<br>Our Father, make us faithful
<br>To serve and love always.</p>
<p>Before us and beside us
<br>Still holden in Thy hand
<br>A cloud of unseen witness
<br>Our elder comrades stand
<br>One family unbroken
<br>We join with one acclaim
<br>One heart one voice uplifting
<br>To glorify Thy name.</p>
