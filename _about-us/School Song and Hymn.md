## School Song

Â (Music and Lyrics by Vivian Quek)
 

In these sound walls a goodly learning frame  
Who here abide true kindliness impart  
With steadfast love, devotion firm inflame  
The fire that waits in every heart.

_For Charity, Patience,  
Devotion let's be known.  
These qualities St. Margaret's shown  
On which our school has grown._

We learn to serve our God, our State, our School  
In service free for neighbour, home and friend  
So may we keep the all embracing rule  
In care for all our lives to spend.

When life brings pain, when trials us defy  
Our faith, our hope, our discipline require  
Us to withstand respond with spirit high  
St. Margaret's shall again inspire.

## School Hymn



Our Father, by whose servants  
Our school was built of old  
Whose hand hath crowned her children  
With blessings manifold  
For Thine unfailing mercies  
Far strewn along our way  
With all who passed before us  
We praise Thy name today.

The changeful years unresting  
Their silent course have sped  
New comrades ever bringing  
In comrades' steps to tread  
And some are long forgotten  
Long spent their hopes and fears  
Safe rest they in Thy keeping  
Who changest not with years.

They reap not where they laboured  
We reap what they have sown  
Our harvest may be garnered  
By ages yet unknown  
The days of old have dowered us  
With gifts beyond all praise  
Our Father, make us faithful  
To serve and love always.

Before us and beside us  
Still holden in Thy hand  
A cloud of unseen witness  
Our elder comrades stand  
One family unbroken  
We join with one acclaim  
One heart one voice uplifting  
To glorify Thy name.
