    <td>The green background represents creation, of which we are part. It stands for life and activity, creativity and growth. <br><br>The white band running diagonally across the crest stands for purity in thought, word and deed. <br><br>The white cross represents the Christian Mission of the school. Like a directional compass, it shows us the right path to take and points us to God's love, truth and provision.<br><br>The sash at the base of the emblem represents the friendship ties that bind all who are in the St. Margaret's family.</td>
