This 180<sup>th</sup> Anniversary commemorative mural was painted in 2022 by students and teachers from the Gear Up programme. The elements of the mural were designed based on the theme: ‘Let our Light Shine’.  

  

A lighthouse stands firmly at the right of the mural. This centrepiece draws inspiration from Matthew 5:16 which reads ’Let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven’. This signifies our students’ desire to demonstrate the school value of showing care to others: to be a source of joy, hope and encouragement to people around them. It further serves as a reminder of our school motto of devotion, to remain steadfast in our commitment to uphold our beliefs and principles, regardless of the challenging situations around us. We must let our lives be a shining example to all around us. #BeALight

  

As a group, the flock of starlings successfully connects and cooperates to ward off predators. While there is leadership, there is no discernible leader. Our students are leaders who seek to serve and in so doing, strengthen others in the community. While being connected and contributing to the community, they grow into confident, creative and caring young ladies who will serve God, the Country and the Community. #BeConnected

  

To the left of the mural, we are presented with an abundant field, resplendent with blooming flowers. The first draws from Matthew 6:8 which reads ‘See how the flowers of the field grow. They do not labor or spin’. The lilies that dot the field are also representative of the lily of the valley from Song of Solomon 2:2 which reads ‘Like a lily among thorns is my darling among the young women’. It is a symbolic representation of our students’ dedication to uphold the school value of being resilient as they seek to thrive in difficult circumstances. #BeWell
