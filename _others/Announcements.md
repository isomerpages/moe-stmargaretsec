### Monthly Concession Pass Refund for Students during Phase 2 (Heightened Alert)

In view of Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) and full Home-Based Learning period from 19 to 28 May 2021, Transit Link Pte Ltd (TransitLink) recognises that most students would not have to take public transport during this period.

The refund amount will be based on the unused days of the pass during the valid refund period and will be made by way of a public transport electronic voucher.

Students can redeem the public transport eVoucher at any TransitLink Ticket Office (TLTO)/ Concession Card Replacement Office (CCRO)/ Add-Value Machine/ TransitLink Kiosk/ Top-up Kiosk/ Assisted Service Kiosk by crediting it to their concession card, or use it to offset the price for the next MCP purchase starting from 17 Jun to 30 Sep 2021.

### Safe Management Measures in School and Travel Advisory

**Safe Management Measures**
<br>
Students are to practise good personal hygiene habits and be socially responsible. If they feel unwell, they must seek medical attention and not come to school. Students will continue to be screened for flu-like symptoms and students with such symptoms will be sent home immediately.

**Ensuring Compliance with Mandatory TT-only SafeEntry**

From Monday, 17 May, students will need to show their TT Token to their teachers in class during daily attendance and temperature-taking. As per our school policy, smartphone usage in class with TT App will not be accepted for this exercise. Students are to carry their tokens with them wherever they go within the school premises.  
  
**Travel Advisory and Travel Declarations**

Students should continue to defer all travel overseas unless it is permissible under the prevailing MOH’s travel advisory. Travel declarations will be collected from students who intend to travel from Monday, 10 May via Parents Gateway (PG). Parents who are not onboard PG may request for a hardcopy form through the Form Teachers. The deadline to return the declarations is Friday, 21 May.  Students who are not travelling need not submit a travel declaration.

International students (ISes) who are travelling out of Singapore must apply for entry approval to return to Singapore via the Safe Travel Office (STO) online portal accessible at [https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO](https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO).

### \[Parent Kit\] Transitioning Back to School – It’s a New Normal for Us 

With the end of the Circuit Breaker on 1 Jun 2020, we enter the phase of safe opening. 2 Jun 2020 marks the beginning of a brand new school term. This new term with new arrangements and routines will be a new normal for all of us.  

Please access the [Parent Kit](/files/Resource%20Kit%20-%20Parent%20Kit%20-%20Back%20to%20School.pdf) from MOE which will help you to understand Back to School arrangements better and how you can guide your daughter/ward to adjust back to school. We also ask for your support to keep our school and children safe, as you have done before the start of Full HBL. Pages 7 to 10 of the Parent Kit provides information on how you can do so.   

In SMSS, we are working behind the scenes to prepare our school to ensure the safety of our students so that learning can continue when school re-opens. Please look out for the June Principal’s Letter on Tuesday, 2 June. We look forward to welcoming our students back in school!
