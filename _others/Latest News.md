### International Mathematical Modelling Challenge (IMMC)

IMMC is a mathematical competition that promotes the teaching of mathematical modeling and applications at all educational levels for all students. It is based on the firm belief that students and teachers need to experience the power of mathematics to help better understand, analyze and solve real world problems outside of mathematics itself – and to do so in realistic contexts.  

Each year, teams are given a realistic problem which they need to think of the best solution to. Teams are encouraged to think out of the box and use various mathematical methods to solve the problem as best they can. This year's interesting problem was to create plane boarding and disembarking methods that will be the most time-effective in real life practice. Furthermore, the solution created should be applicable to various plane sizes and models. 

Over the course of one week, our team managed to come up with an elegant solution to the problem and impress the judges. 

We are pleased to share that the team was awarded the Certificate of Commendation. 

Congratulations girls! We hope that you continue to make use of your mathematical ability to give practical solutions for real-life problems.

### SLS Avatar Competition 2021

While most students were enjoying their school holidays, Lim Sher Min (S4-4) ventured out of her comfort zone and picked up her digital pen to put her creativity juices to work.

On TikTok, she came across the SLS (Student Learning Space) Avatar Competition organised by the SLS Design and Development Team at MOE.

As President of the Creative Arts Club, Sher Min is no stranger to creating digital designs. She has, however, never digitally drawn an avatar before.

She shared, “I drew an avatar of an explorer as I felt that it best reflects the process of learning, which was the theme I selected. Learning is an adventure that students embark on, exploring new realms and constantly discovering new things. My avatar had a hat and vest, complete with a magnifying glass, symbolising curiosity and a hunger to find out more.”

“I enjoyed my time devoted to drawing and fine tuning my first avatar until I was finally happy to submit it. It was a pleasant surprise when I learnt that I was one of the winners of the competition.”

We rejoice with Sher Min whose avatar was selected as one of the 24 winning designs out of more than 8,500 entries for the competition.

Congratulations Sher Min!

### Singapore Remote Sensing Workshop 2021

The inaugural “SG Remote Sensing Workshop: Observing the Earth from Space” was organised by The Office for Space Technology and Industry (OSTIn), Singapore’s national space office. Held from 22 November to 3 December 2021 at NUS, it gave students a hands-on experience with satellite imagery.

Our students, Ng Meiying and Priscilla Tan (from Secondary 4-4) had the privilege of participating in the programme.

Priscilla was grateful for the opportunity as she “got to interact with different students who shared a common interest in Geography." She was able to learn new skills and was amazed by how far a Geography topic can be extended. As for Meiying, the experience proved to be very fruitful and “if given the opportunity to go again, I would definitely take up the chance".

The group achieved the 'Best Overall' Award! Their teacher-in-charge, Ms Priscilla Lim, shared that the workshop was quite intense and there was a lot of information about statistics that the students had to handle and digest.

### Green Plan Challenge

Amidst the busyness and demands of the year, Rachel Sonsun (S4-4) has shown what it means to “let one’s light shine” through her service to the community during the Green Plan Challenge held at Punggol.

Rachel’s role as a Green Coach was to provide teams with a short introduction about the Treelodge when they arrived at her station situated at Treelodge@Punggol. Following this, they would be required to complete 2 tasks based on her introduction. 

Rachel’s willingness to carve out time to serve the community through creating awareness of biodiversity and Singapore’s sustainability efforts is truly inspiring. Rachel’s key takeaway from her participation in this Challenge was that it allowed her to interact with people from various walks of life. She was also gratified to see their eagerness to learn more about their estate. Truly, Rachel’s contribution to the success of this event embodies the St. Margaret’s vision of “a community of learners growing and glowing for God”, and fulfils our school mission of “serving God, the community and the country”.
