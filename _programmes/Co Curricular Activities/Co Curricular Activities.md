Objectives
----------

Co-Curricular activities play a key role in the holistic development of our pupils. They aim to provide healthy recreational activities and at the same time imbibe correct values, build character and promote social integration through students’ continuous participation.

CCA Policy
----------

*   Every secondary school student is required to take part in one main CCA, which can be from one of the following categories: Sports, Performing Arts, Uniformed Groups or Clubs.
    
*   Participation has to be continuous with 75% attendance throughout the secondary school course before points can be considered. Absence from any CCA session must be supported by medical certificates or letters from parents stating a valid reason.
    

LEAPS 2.0 CCA Grading System
----------------------------

To provide students with a holistic and well-rounded experience in the co-curriculum, we have introduced the LEAPS 2.0 framework in secondary schools since 2014. LEAPS 2.0 aims to schools to better align their co-curriculum to encourage students’ holistic development in life skills, competencies and values.

  

LEAPS 2.0 has 4 domains as shown below:

*   Participation
*   Service
*   Leadership
*   Achievement

  

More information on LEAPS 2.0 and the conversion of level of Attainment to Bonus Points can be obtained from the MOE's website at
