Education and Career Guidance
=============================

Education and Career Guidance (ECG) develops each student's self-identity and ability to make education and career choices. To meet students’ developmental needs, ECG implementation in schools emphasises different aspects as students’ progress from primary to post-secondary school levels. ECG lessons and experiences, complemented by the MySkillsFuture Student Portal, enable students to make informed education and career choices, and empower them for lifelong learning.

Goals of Education and Career Guidance
--------------------------------------

**1.** Nurture student’s self-awareness and self-directedness to support them in discovering their purpose in life and charting their education and career journey;  
  
**2.** Develop students’ growth mindset and work resilience to embrace the need for lifelong learning and career adaptability;  
  
**3.** Build students’ understanding of the value of occupations across society and gender equality in career opportunities; and  
  
**4.** Equip students with skills and means to positively engage their parents and other career influencers such as teachers, trusted adults and         
industry partners.

In St. Margaret’s, ECG lessons conducted within the CCE curriculum and school experiences, complemented by the MySkillsFuture Student Portal, aim to enable students to make informed education and career choices, and empower them for lifelong learning. The focus of ECG at the Secondary level is to allow students to develop self-awareness, explore possible career pathways and discover various education options. 

  

The school ECG programme enhances the curriculum through customised experiences, including the Work Exploration Programme, Work Attachment/ Job Shadowing Programme and ECG Fest. To provide support to students applying for EAE or DSA, teacher mentorship and training in portfolio-building, course specific write-up and interview skills are conducted. The following lists the information related to the school programmes. Our students can refer to the [Student Learning Site](https://sites.google.com/moe.edu.sg/smssstudentsportal/ecg) for more details on these programmes
