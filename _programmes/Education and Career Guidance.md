<h1>Education and Career Guidance</h1>
<p>Education and Career Guidance (ECG) develops each student's self-identity
and ability to make education and career choices. To meet students’ developmental
needs, ECG implementation in schools emphasises different aspects as students’
progress from primary to post-secondary school levels. ECG lessons and
experiences, complemented by the MySkillsFuture Student Portal, enable
students to make informed education and career choices, and empower them
for lifelong learning.</p>

<p>In St. Margaret’s, ECG lessons conducted within the CCE curriculum and
school experiences, complemented by the MySkillsFuture Student Portal,
aim to enable students to make informed education and career choices, and
empower them for lifelong learning. The focus of ECG at the Secondary level
is to allow students to develop self-awareness, explore possible career
pathways and discover various education options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The school ECG programme enhances the curriculum through customised experiences,
including the Work Exploration Programme, Work Attachment/ Job Shadowing
Programme and ECG Fest. To provide support to students applying for EAE
or DSA, teacher mentorship and training in portfolio-building, course specific
write-up and interview skills are conducted. The following lists the information
related to the school programmes. Our students can refer to the&nbsp;
