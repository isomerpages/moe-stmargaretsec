St. Margaret’s Secondary School has a robust and developmental Career Guidance Programme that has been in place since 1999.

To help our students to be informed of making the right choice of continuing their education in a junior college or polytechnic as well as the various Junior College subject combinations available to them, the school organises an annual Career Fair for the graduating cohort. This is to allow them to have a vision of where they see themselves in the near future and it is useful for our graduating students who will be making their decision in the coming year.

The school also organises an annual Professional Guidance Day for the graduating classes as part of the larger Career Guidance programme which seeks to give our students more information about the professions they are interested in and provide insights on the realities of the workplace. This helps them make more informed decisions when planning their post-secondary education and the courses they want to pursue upon graduation.

As part of the school’s vision of enriching our students through learning beyond the confines of the classroom, we have in place the Work Attachment and Work Experience Programme. Our students explore their career interests through these industrial attachments and are able to make more informed choices about their subjects and post-secondary choices.

Education and Career Guidance Fair 2022
---------------------------------------

The Education and Career Guidance (ECG) Fair, comprising a series of activities from&nbsp;now till April, provides our graduating students with the opportunity to explore education&nbsp;and career pathways.

Through the sharing by our partners comprising professionals from various industries and&nbsp;educators from institutes of higher learning, the ECG Fair allows our students to gain&nbsp;awareness of the skills, knowledge and attitudes that allow one to contribute and thrive in&nbsp;the various industries, so as to make informed decisions of the courses to apply for after&nbsp;the national examinations.

The content featured during the ECG Fair has been carefully curated to provide the&nbsp;students with good perspectives of the work involved as well as the skill sets and mindsets&nbsp;needed to thrive in this volatile landscape.
