<h3>MOE Sexuality Education in Schools</h3>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools
aims to enable students to understand the physiological, social and emotional
changes they experience as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships
with others, including those with members of the opposite sex, and make
wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters. SEd is premised
on the importance of the family as the basic unit of society. This means
encouraging healthy, heterosexual marriages and stable nuclear family units
with extended family support. The teaching and learning of SEd is based
on respect for the values and beliefs of the different ethnic and religious
communities in Singapore on sexuality issues.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <strong>Goals</strong> of Sexuality
Education are to:</p>
<p><strong>(a) </strong>&nbsp;Support students in managing their physiological,
social and emotional changes as they grow up and develop safe and healthy
relationships.</p>
<p><strong>(b)</strong>&nbsp; Guide students to make wise, informed and responsible
decisions on sexuality matters.</p>
<p><strong>(c)</strong>&nbsp; Help students develop a moral compass and respect
for themselves and others by having positive mainstream values and attitudes
about sexuality that are premised on the family as the basic unit of society.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <strong>Key Messages</strong> of
Sexuality Education are:</p>
<p><strong>(a)</strong>&nbsp; Love and respect yourself as you love and respect
others;</p>
<p><strong>(b)</strong>&nbsp; Build positive relationships based on love
and respect (which are the foundation for strong families);</p>
<p><strong>(c)</strong>&nbsp; Make responsible decisions for yourself, your
family and society; and</p>
<p><strong>(d)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Abstinence before marriage is the best
protection against STIs/HIV and unintended pregnancies. Casual sex can
harm and hurt you and your loved ones.</p>

<h3>Overview of St. Margaret’s School (Secondary)’s Sexuality Education Programme for 2025</h3>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexuality Education is delivered
in a holistic manner through the school curriculum. The content for Sexuality
Education is grouped into five main themes: Human Development, Interpersonal
Relationships, Sexual Health, Sexual Behaviour, and, Culture, Society and
Law. You may click <a href="https://go.gov.sg/moe-sexuality-education-scope" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> for more
information on the scope of Sexuality Education in the school curriculum.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The subjects that incorporate topics
on sexuality include:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Science</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)</p>
<h4>Sexuality Education Lessons:</h4>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The values and attitudes of our
youth towards sexuality are increasingly shaped by their peers, exposure
to the media, popular culture and the internet. Adolescence is a complex
stage in life as the adolescent attempts to find his or her own identity
and often struggles with new social relationships. The period of middle
adolescence (generally from 15 – 17 years old) can be a turbulent period
for adolescents. The gap between physical and emotional/cognitive maturity
may result in a tendency to act on impulse, experiment with various activities
(including sexual activities), sometimes without understanding the unpleasant
consequences that may arise from such experimentation. The need for peer
acceptance can be overwhelmingly strong and hinder one’s ability to act
responsibly.&nbsp; Given the pressures faced by the middle adolescent from
within themselves and from peers, it is important to build a strong sense
of self-worth, personal conviction and an understanding of the possible
consequences of sexual behaviour.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the Sexuality Education
lessons, secondary students will have the opportunity to develop a positive
self-esteem, develop their character, and expand their understanding and
repertoire of skills to deal with various issues related to sexuality,
which are of prime concern at this age.</p>

<h4><strong><em><u>eTeens</u></em><u> Programme</u></strong>:</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>eTeens</em> is a programme developed
by Health Promotion Board, in collaboration with the Ministry of Education,
to provide Secondary 3 students with accurate information on STIs, HIV
and protection from a health perspective. <em>eTeens</em> is conducted in
two segments – a mass talk segment and a classroom-based programme. The
desired outcome of the <em>eTeens</em> programme is that students are empowered
to make wise, informed and sensible decisions.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students are taught skills such
as decision-making, assertiveness and negotiation to say “no” to sex and
negative peer pressure. They also learn that the impact of STIs/HIV extends
beyond themselves and involves their family, and the importance of responsible
decision-making and seeking help. Abstinence and upholding family values
are the key messages.</p>
<p><strong>At St. Margaret’s School (Secondary), the <em>eTeens</em> programme will be implemented as follows in 2025:</strong>
