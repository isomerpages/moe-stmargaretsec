With our niche in the Visual and Performing Arts, St. Margaret’s School (Secondary) provides
different platforms to develop our students’ artistic sensibilities.
  

At the lower secondary level, students’ skills and confidence in drawing, painting, hatching and
colour rendering are developed.  They also learn to manipulate Art software programmes such
as Photoshop to enhance their artwork.

The highlights of the Lower Secondary General Music programme include the playing of
instruments, learning about the elements of music and creative music making. Students also
learn to harness the use of technology to enhance their performance-related activities.

We offer GCE ‘O’ Level Art, Music (and Higher Music) to our Upper Secondary students as
optional subjects. Lessons are conducted within our school.

St. Margaret’s School (Secondary) exposes students to as many art forms as possible. This is
achieved through various enrichment activities held during the post-exam period.  Artistes and
artists are also invited to showcase and share with students their passion in a range of art
forms.

We offer nine different Arts CCAs, namely [Indian Dance](https://stmargaretssec.moe.edu.sg/programmes/co-curricular-activities/indian-dance), [Chinese Dance](https://stmargaretssec.moe.edu.sg/programmes/co-curricular-activities/chinese-dance), [Malay Dance](https://stmargaretssec.moe.edu.sg/programmes/co-curricular-activities/malay-dance), [Modern Dance](https://stmargaretssec.moe.edu.sg/programmes/co-curricular-activities/modern-dance), [Creative Art Club](https://stmargaretssec.moe.edu.sg/programmes/co-curricular-activities/creative-art-club-visual-art), [English Drama](https://stmargaretssec.moe.edu.sg/programmes/co-curricular-activities/english-drama), [Concert Band](https://stmargaretssec.moe.edu.sg/programmes/co-curricular-activities/concert-band), [String Ensemble](https://stmargaretssec.moe.edu.sg/programmes/co-curricular-activities/string-ensemble) and [Choir](https://stmargaretssec.moe.edu.sg/programmes/co-curricular-activities/choir). Qualified instructors provide training in the different skills pertaining to each art form. Opportunities are
