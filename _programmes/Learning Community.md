<p>St. Margaret's School (Secondary) offers a unique educational experience
that seeks to nurture collaborative learners capable of critical and independent
thought. The school curriculum aims to meet the demands of an economy that
is constantly changing. Thus, school programmes are designed to develop
adaptable learners who are able to apply knowledge and skills acquired
in the classroom to authentic situations and real-world problems. School
programmes are also designed to help students gain a deeper understanding
of subject matter and see the broad connections between different fields
of knowledge and everyday experience. The St. Margaret’s School (Secondary)
student can look forward to learner-centered and activity-based lessons
that encourage them to reflect on issues and be more appreciative of different
perspectives.</p>
<h2>Critical Thinking Programme</h2>
<p>Critical Thinking (CT) is a key aspect of learning and the CT framework
is embedded in the pedagogy for some subjects, including Secondary&nbsp;Two
Project Work. In these subjects, students learn to make distinctions between
organised thoughts and purposeful thinking. The result is the development
of a mind that is able to think critically across different domains. In
Project Work (PW), our students can choose between competitive or non-competitive
PW domains. In both domains, students have the option of exploring their
interest in Humanities, Science, Mathematics and the English Language.
Over the course of the project, students are taught to apply analytical
skills and consider different perspectives in order to come up with solutions
to real-world problems.</p>
<h2>Environmental and Life Sciences Programme</h2>
<p>The Science and Humanities Departments have designed several experiential
programmes that enhance students’ understanding of scientific and environmental
concepts. In the school’s Environmental and Life Sciences Programme, students
are also encouraged to be committed to improving the environment and standards
of living. Partnerships with NParks, learning journeys to various scientific
institutes around Singapore and research attachment opportunities with
Singapore Polytechnic and the Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology
are also part of the programme.</p>
<h2>Environment Education Programme</h2>
<p>St. Margaret's School (Secondary) also actively promotes the 3Rs (Reduce,
Reuse, Recycle) through meaningful programmes in our Environment Education
Programme. The school's Environment Education Advisers (EEAs), NYAA environment
leaders and class environment representatives spearhead the rest of the
student body to participate in activities that promote the 3Rs and to create
awareness among our students to reduce waste through upcycling of plastics,
paper, glass and metals. An example of such an activity would be involving
our class monitors from all levels to set up booths in the canteen to sell
upcycled items.</p>
