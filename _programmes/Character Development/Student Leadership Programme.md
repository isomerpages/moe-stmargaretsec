St. Margaret’s is guided by the five practices of The Leadership Challenge in developing students to be leaders of moral courage. All students acquire and demonstrate these practices during level camps. Students also undergo the National Youth Achievement Award (Silver) programme as part of their leadership journey. The school offers a variety of leadership opportunities across different platforms such as the class, House, CCA and Student Council. 

The school also offers a unique leadership experience for specially selected student leaders. These student leaders form the Student Leadership Challenge (SLC) Board. The SLC Board imparts the five Leadership Practices, as espoused by Kouzes-Posner’s Leadership Challenge, to the school population through mass leadership training sessions and team building activities. Through these activities, the SLC leaders enable others to act by instilling school values and leadership principles in students. 

A signature values education programme offered by the school is the Ethical Choice (EtCh) programme. This programme has been designed to develop the moral reasoning competencies of students by engaging them in discussions on moral dilemmas. EtCh builds on the school's strengths – an outstanding character development programme, innovative teaching and learning practices as well as a dynamic student leadership. EtCh is implemented through the upper secondary student leaders for the Secondary One students. The leaders are specially selected and equipped with skills to both design material and facilitate EtCh lessons for their juniors. Each lesson engages students on a moral dilemma which is linked to the school's comprehensive integrated values framework. The dilemmas, constructed by EtCh leaders under the guidance of teachers, are made more relevant, applicable and contextualized for the students of the school.
