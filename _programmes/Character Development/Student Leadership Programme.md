<p>St. Margaret’s is guided by the five practices of The Leadership Challenge
in developing students to be leaders of moral courage. All students acquire
and demonstrate these practices during level camps. Students also undergo
the National Youth Achievement Award (Silver) programme as part of their
leadership journey. The school offers a variety of leadership opportunities
across different platforms such as the class, House, CCA and Student Council.</p>
<p>The school also offers a unique leadership experience for specially selected
student leaders. These student leaders form the Student Leadership Challenge
(SLC) Board. The SLC Board imparts the five Leadership Practices, as espoused
by Kouzes-Posner’s Leadership Challenge, to the school population through
mass leadership training sessions and team building activities. Through
these activities, the SLC leaders enable others to act by instilling school
values and leadership principles in students.</p>
<p>A signature values education programme offered by the school is the Ethical
Choice (EtCh) programme. This programme has been designed to develop the
moral reasoning competencies of students by engaging them in discussions
on moral dilemmas. EtCh builds on the school's strengths – an outstanding
character development programme, innovative teaching and learning practices
as well as a dynamic student leadership. EtCh is implemented through the
upper secondary student leaders for the Secondary One students. The leaders
are specially selected and equipped with skills to both design material
and facilitate EtCh lessons for their juniors. Each lesson engages students
on a moral dilemma which is linked to the school's comprehensive integrated
values framework. The dilemmas, constructed by EtCh leaders under the guidance
of teachers, are made more relevant, applicable and contextualized for
the students of the school.</p>
