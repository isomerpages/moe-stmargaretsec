<p>The aim of the Character Development Programme is the holistic development
of our students. Character development permeates all facets of school-life
and is an integral part of the planning process in many of our programmes.</p>
<p>Our long-term character development framework marks out our plans to develop
our students in personal responsibility, social responsibility and leadership
development.</p>
<p>St. Margaret's School (Secondary)&nbsp;is a school rich in heritage, with
a history strong in care and concern, and this is demonstrated in the school’s
community service programme. To ensure that our students are prepared to
take on the world, the school actively exposes our students to various
programmes integral in helping them build strength in character. With a
strong career guidance programme, an extensive network of overseas exchanges,
a progressive leadership programme and a dynamic CCA programme, the school
aims to develop young ladies who are confident, creative and caring.</p>
<p>The school has a developmental programme that trains all students in leadership
and moulds selected students in their roles as Student Leaders. Through
workshops, conferences and camps, leaders are trained to facilitate and
lead in projects.</p>
