The Bounce Programme is a co-curricular programme aimed at providing holistic development of our students, creating a quality school experience for them as they experience the joy of learning. The programme focuses on experiential learning via enrichment modules and service learning opportunities.  

The ‘9+1’ is a component within the Bounce Programme for our Secondary 1 Normal (Technical) course students to better prepare them for a smoother transition to secondary school life. Students participate in activities that help them to draw connections between what they learn during lessons and authentic experiences.

To help students plan and manage their career pathways and learning, Bounce provides opportunities for our Secondary 2 Normal (Technical) and Secondary 3 Normal (Academic) course students to attend the Experience ITE Programme. 

Elective Modules are also planned for our Secondary 2 and Secondary 3 Normal (Technical) course students to broaden their learning experiences beyond the curriculum and engage them through applied learning. The Secondary 3 students also participate in the Advanced Elective Modules where they get to discover more about their interests and make informed education and career choices.

A teacher-mentor scheme is in place to provide additional support to our Secondary 4 Normal (Technical) course students during their preparation for the ITE Early Admissions Exercise.

Another component within Bounce is the Gear-Up Programme which offers our students the opportunity to strengthen school-connectedness and build positive peer relationships. For the Gear-Up Programme sessions this year, students will take part in a variety of sessions that will cater to their different needs and individual interests. These sessions include the Lifeskills programme, 180th Wall Mural Design and DOTs Sports activities.
