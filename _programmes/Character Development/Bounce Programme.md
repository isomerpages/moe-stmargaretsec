<p>The Bounce Programme is a co-curricular programme aimed at providing holistic
development of our students, creating a quality school experience for them
as they experience the joy of learning. The programme focuses on experiential
learning via enrichment modules and service learning opportunities.</p>
<p>The ‘9+1’ is a component within the Bounce Programme for our Secondary
1 Normal (Technical) course students to better prepare them for a smoother
transition to secondary school life. Students participate in activities
that help them to draw connections between what they learn during lessons
and authentic experiences.</p>

<p>To help students plan and manage their career pathways and learning, Bounce
provides opportunities for our Secondary 2 Normal (Technical) and Secondary
3 Normal (Academic) course students to attend the Experience ITE Programme.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elective Modules are also planned for our Secondary 2 and Secondary 3
Normal (Technical) course students to broaden their learning experiences
beyond the curriculum and engage them through applied learning. The Secondary
3 students also participate in the Advanced Elective Modules where they
get to discover more about their interests and make informed education
and career choices.</p>
<p>A teacher-mentor scheme is in place to provide additional support to our
Secondary 4 Normal (Technical) course students during their preparation
for the ITE Early Admissions Exercise.</p>

our students the opportunity to strengthen school-connectedness and&nbsp;build
positive peer relationships. For the Gear-Up Programme sessions this year,
students will take part in a variety of sessions that will cater to their
different needs and individual interests. These sessions include the Lifeskills
programme, 180th&nbsp;Wall Mural Design and DOTs Sports activities</p>
