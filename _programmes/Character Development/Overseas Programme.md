<p>In line with the school’s mission and vision of nurturing global citizens,
St. Margaret’s School (Secondary) has developed a comprehensive Overseas
Programme that encompasses different aspects of learning.</p>
<p>Our Overseas Programme involves exchange programmes, community service,
subject specific trips and partnerships. The ultimate goal of the programme
is to educate and expose our students to the world, so as to equip them
with essential skills and knowledge that would stand them in good stead
in their quest for a better understanding of the different cultures and
economic/political systems. Our students would be able to contribute to
the global economy in terms of community service or as global citizens
in the future.</p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>To nurture global citizens who are equipped with life skills, knowledge
and caring hearts, much thought is put into the planning of overseas programmes.</p>
<p>The school decides on the purpose of the trips and how it would enhance
our objective of nurturing global citizens. The following are questions
addressed in the course of our planning:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Would our students gain life skills and knowledge from the trip?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Would our students be able to utilize such skills and knowledge in the
future?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Would our students be able to contribute to the betterment of a community
from the trip?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Would our students be better global citizens after the trip?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Students are chosen according to the following criteria:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Good conduct</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teachers’ recommendations / endorsements</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Target Group</h2>
<p>The&nbsp;main target group is Secondary One to Three students.</p>
<hr>
<p>However, end-of-year VIA trips can also&nbsp;involve graduating students.</p>
<h2>Processes</h2>
<p>Basic information is given to the student population to facilitate their
decision on which trip they would like to participate in. Students are
invited to sign up for any trip but are informed that there would be a
selection process. The selection process is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sign-up by Secondary One to Three students (Secondary Four and Five students
are expected to be preparing for major exams).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teachers are asked to provide feedback on all students who sign up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shortlisted students are interviewed to determine their suitability for
the trip.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A final list is sent to all staff for endorsement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students are notified of the results of their application.</p>
</li>
</ul>
