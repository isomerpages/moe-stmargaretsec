In line with the school mission and vision of nurturing caring young ladies,&nbsp;St. Margaret's School (Secondary)&nbsp;has in place a developmental Values in Action (VIA) Programme which encompasses various facets of the community. Our young ladies become Other-Centred Contributors who are willing to act and serve others.

The local VIA programme includes the following:&nbsp;  

*   Outreach to the Community&nbsp;
*   Outreach to the Elderly
*   Outreach to Disadvantaged Groups and&nbsp;
*   Care for the Environment.

By the end of a student’s four or five-year term with the school, she would have experienced the various aspects of community service and developed a sense of compassion for the less fortunate. Inspired, she will continue to serve the community beyond school.  

  

Objectives
----------

In 2017, SMSS redesigned the way VIA projects were conducted through Project Work (PW). The school tapped on the strengths and affordances of both VIA and PW and combined them into a novel service learning programme, the Salt &amp; Light Programme (SLP). Currently, SLP is part of the lower secondary curriculum where students work on a social issue for a year while the programme is weaved into Character and Citizenship Education lessons for the upper secondary students.

SLP empowers students to exercise greater choice and ownership of their VIA projects which are beneficiary-centred. As students work effectively in teams to ideate and initiate solutions for innovative community engagements, their leadership skills are honed while teamwork, creativity and confidence are nurtured. SLP involves active learning with a focus on critical thinking and problem-solving skills as students take on real community issues.  

Through SLP, students grow to become a community of learners who value the importance of being empathetic and giving back to society.&nbsp;

## Internationalisation Trips (LIGHT of the World)

The Light of the World programme aims to foster cross-cultural friendships while helping students develop leadership and communication skills through meaningful Values-in-Action (VIA) projects. By travelling overseas, students are exposed to diverse learning experiences beyond their comfort zones, encouraging personal growth and a deeper sense of purpose in serving others. These trips also offer valuable opportunities for students to bond with their peers and strengthen their ability to collaborate effectively as a team.
