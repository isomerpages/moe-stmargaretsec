St Margaret&#39;s School (Secondary) aims to empower students to become future-ready learners who
navigate the digital age, adapt to change, and contribute meaningfully to society. Our National
Digital Literacy Programme nurtures critical thinking and information literacy skills. Through
strategic integration of ICT, students analyze, evaluate, and synthesize information from digital
sources, developing a discerning mindset. Classroom activities, enrichment programmes and
competitions give students the opportunities to practice think, apply and create which help to foster
computational thinking, problem-solving, and logical reasoning competencies as well as creativity
and innovation in our students.
By honing digital literacy skills, students effectively and responsibly use technology for learning
and growth. They leverage digital tools and platforms to enhance their education, taking ownership
of their learning journeys and adapting to new information and technologies. Collaboration,
appreciation of diversity, and contribution to an inclusive learning environment are nurtured.
Students become socially responsible citizens who engage with their communities and make
meaningful contributions to society.
