<p>St. Margaret’s School (Secondary) equips students with digital competencies,
literacy skills, and opportunities to become future-ready, other-centered
learners with a growth mindset. Harnessing the affordance of technology,
students learn continuously, build positive connections, and contribute
meaningfully to society. Equipped with various digital literacy competencies,
students can effectively use digital productivity tools and platforms to
support their learning inside and outside the classroom, foster digital
collaboration, and encourage self-directed learning. They will also become
socially responsible citizens who practise cyber wellness and navigate
digital spaces safely, ethically, and effectively. By integrating ICT into
the curriculum and offering technology-based enrichment programs and competitions,
students gain opportunities to practise “Find, Think, Apply, and Create”.
This approach develops computational thinking, problem-solving, and logical
reasoning skills. As students creatively and skillfully use a range of
digital tools, they also learn empathy, identifying needs and developing
solutions for real-world problems</p>
