<p>In March 2020, MOE launched the NDLP for all Secondary Schools to help
students strengthen their digital literacy. One of the components of the
NDLP is to facilitate the ownership of a Personal Learning Device for all
secondary school students by the end of 2021.</p>
<p>Singapore citizens will be able to utilise the funds in their Edusave
account to&nbsp;offset the cost&nbsp;for their Personal Learning Device.</p>
<p>Students who are Singapore citizens from lower-income families will enjoy
further subsidies for the purchase.&nbsp;</p>
