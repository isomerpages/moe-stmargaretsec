In March 2020, MOE launched the NDLP for all Secondary Schools to help students strengthen their digital literacy. One of the components of the NDLP is to facilitate the ownership of a Personal Learning Device for all secondary school students by the end of 2021.

Singapore citizens will be able to utilise the funds in their Edusave account to&nbsp;offset the cost&nbsp;for their Personal Learning Device.

Students who are Singapore citizens from lower-income families will enjoy further subsidies for the purchase.&nbsp;
