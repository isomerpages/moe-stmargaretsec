The Enhanced Music Programme (EMP) is offered at St. Margaret’s Secondary School's. This is a two-year upper secondary programme that allows students with music potential, aptitude and passion to pursue an in-depth study of music. St. Margaret’s Secondary School also serves as an 'O' Level Music Centre for students from other schools.

The vision of the St. Margaret's Secondary School EMP is to create a community of confident and creative musicians. To this end, we are committed to nurturing musically talented Lower Secondary students who may wish to join the EMP at the Upper Secondary Level. To enter the programme, applicants (at Secondary Two) need to pass a written Selection Test and participate in an audition conducted by music teachers. The audition could be on any instrument, including the use of vocals.

The EMP is a two-year programme starting at Secondary Three and ending with the GCE 'O' Level Music Examinations. The syllabus includes an in-depth study of Asian, Classical, Jazz, Popular and Multimedia genres. Apart from classroom lessons that introduce students to the music of Western and Asian traditions, students are also engaged in workshops that provide hands-on experiences (e.g. gamelan workshop and Indian music workshop) to gain deeper insights into the cultural context.

There are opportunities for students to attend composition workshops by local composers. Through such workshops, students become acquainted with real composers and are inspired to think more deeply about communicating their thoughts and ideas through music.

At the combined schools' music camp, there are opportunities to collaborate and learn with EMP and Music Elective Programme (MEP) students from other schools, and to learn from music industry professionals.

The EMP at St. Margaret’s Secondary School is well-supported by a variety of music co-curricular activities, namely the Choir, String Ensemble and Concert Band.

All in all, the EMP at St. Margaret’s Secondary School aims to develop in its students a strong interest in music and deepen their understanding of music as a whole.
