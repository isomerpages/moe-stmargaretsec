<h2>Who We Are <br>PSG Mission</h2>
<p>To promote a partnership between the school and parents by meeting the
needs of the students, teachers and parents.</p>
<p>The Parent Support Group (PSG) was formed in 1998 by a group of caring
and committed parents to support the school and to participate in their
daughters’ education and development. Starting with a small group of less
than 10 parents, the SMS(S) PSG has grown to an impressive 550 members
made up of active parent volunteers who support the school in various areas.</p>
<p>The school is also blessed with the PSG Alumni, formed in 2005 to facilitate
the continuing fellowship amongst parents whose daughters have graduated.</p>
<p>The group plays a supportive role in school programmes and activities
in enriching our girls’ SMS(S) education experience. Some key programmes
supported by the PSG include school learning journeys, post-examination
activities and NE commemorative days.</p>
