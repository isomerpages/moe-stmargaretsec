<p>The new PSLE Scoring and S1 Posting System took effect in 2021. Please

<h2>Indicative Scoring</h2>
<p>A new PSLE scoring system has been implemented since 2021 in which students
will be scored by Achievement Levels (AL) based on their individual performance
in the PSLE subjects, regardless of how their peers have done. To view
the Cut-off points (COP) for our school you may visit the Info site for
P6 Parents and Students here: <a href="https://sites.google.com/stmargs.edu.sg/smssinfosite/introduction" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Info site for P6 Parents and Students.</a>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Students can also consider the Direct School Admission (DSA)-Secondary
as an alternative admission pathway. The DSA recognises students' diverse
talents and achievements in areas that are not demonstrated at the PSLE,
such as sports, performing arts and leadership.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aside from the PSLE scores, there are other equally important factors
when considering what would be a good fit for your child’s overall learning
needs. For example, the schools' distinctive programmes, Co-Curricular
Activities, ethos and culture, as well as home-school distance. For a more
holistic understanding of our school, please visit the St. Margaret’s Secondary
School Schoolfinder <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/schoolfinder?journey=Secondary%20school" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">link</a>.</p>
