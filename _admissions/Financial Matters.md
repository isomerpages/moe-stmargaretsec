<p>The annual school fees payable are spread over 12 months of the academic
year. Students who are&nbsp;admitted on or before 5th February will have
to pay fees from January. Those who withdraw on&nbsp;or after 5th October

mode of payment is GIRO.</p>

</p>
<p>Singapore Citizen students can choose to pay the second-tier miscellaneous
fees and the school&nbsp;autonomous fees from their Edusave account.</p>
<p>Please approach the school's General Office to speak with Ms Jane Loh

<br>^ICBC customers must use their 11-digit account number for GIRO setup
<br>
<br>Other bank account holders will need to complete a hardcopy GIRO application
form and submit the original signed form to the school. There is no need
to submit a new application if students are already on GIRO. Deductions
will be made on the 26th day of each month (February – December).
<br>
<br>If the 26th day of the month is a weekend or public holiday, the deduction
will happen on the next working day. The fees for January and February
are combined into one bill for deduction in February, hence there will
not be any deduction in January. Please ensure that there are sufficient
funds in the bank account for deduction.

please contact Ms Jane Loh at 6466 4525.</p>
<h2>Registration for PayNow</h2>
<p>With the increasing digitalisation of government services, MOE would like
to encourage all parents to register their children’s bank account with
PayNow using the children’s BC/NRIC number. The activation of PayNow will
facilitate the prompt disbursement of monies (e.g. Edusave award) for the
child, and avoid delays through the filling in and processing of forms
or from physical visits to banks for the deposit of cheques.</p>
<h2>Insurance Coverage for Students</h2>
<p>Each student is covered with a Group Personal Accident (GPA) Insurance
which provides coverage when she is:</p>
<p>(a) in school;</p>
<p>b) participating in the school’s activities, or any activity related to
the school, including&nbsp;home-based learning and blended learning, Co-curricular
Activities (CCAs) and sports,&nbsp;regardless of the time at which such
activities are conducted and whether the activity is&nbsp;conducted in
the school, in Singapore, or elsewhere;</p>
<p>c) commuting from (or to) her place of residence, including a hostel,
to (or from) either&nbsp;the school’s premises or the place where an activity
covered by the GPA Insurance will&nbsp;be conducted, including any reasonable
deviations. For the avoidance of doubt, the&nbsp;student’s place of residence
may include a place that is not in Singapore.</p>
<p>All claims should be submitted as soon as possible subjected to a cap
of 365 days from the date of accident.</p>
<p>Submission of claims can be done online via&nbsp;<a href="https://studentgpa.incomegroupins.com.sg/#/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Income’s GPA portal</a>
